## Description

- **TP1 - Basic Image Processing**: This notebook covers the fundamentals of image processing techniques such as image enhancement, filtering, and transformations, noise addition, and histogram computing.

- **TP2 - Basic Cryptography Watermarking**: In this notebook, you will explore the basics of cryptographic techniques used in watermarking and steganography. 
Watermarking involves embedding hidden information within multimedia content, while steganography focuses on concealing information within the cover media.

- **TP3 - Detection Theory**: The focus of this notebook is on detection theory, including the analysis of detection performance and the trade-off between detection probability and false alarm rate.
 It also covers the creation of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs to visualize the trade-off between detection probability and false alarm rate.

- **TP4 - Watermark Detection**: This notebook provides an introduction to watermark detection techniques, where you will learn how to extract and verify watermarks embedded in multimedia content.
